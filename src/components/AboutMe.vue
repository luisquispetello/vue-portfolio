    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! This is Luis. I am a result-focused, flexible problem-solver and
      fullstack designer with more than 3 years of experience working as a
      freelancer. I consider myself a proficient designer and a pragmatic developer, however, I will
      always be willing to learn, improve and take advantage of every
      opportunity that comes my way. Fearless of being out of my comfort zone
      and willing to work abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have a background in the world of bespoke tailoring working as a
      apprentice for 2 years in Madrid where I learned to be meticulous in all I
      do and adapt quickly to new work environments.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a curiosity in my free time I train weightlifting and do the genealogy
      research of my family.
    </p>
    <p>My skills: UI/UX design, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Vue.JS framework</p>
    <p>Tools: Figma, Adobe Illustrator and VScode</p>
