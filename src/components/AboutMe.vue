    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! This is Luis. I am a result-focused, flexible problem-solver and
      self-taught frontend developer with 2 years of experience working as a
      freelancer. I consider myself a proficient programmer, however, I will
      always be willing to learn, improve and take advantage of every
      opportunity that comes my way. Fearless of being out of my comfort zone
      and willing to travel.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a background in the world of bespoke tailoring
      working as a apprentice for 2 years in Madrid where I learned to be
      meticulous in all I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a curiosity in my free time I train weightlifting and do the genealogy research of my parents.
    </p>
    <p>My skills: Javascript, HTML, CSS, Vue framework and UI/UX design</p>
    <p>Tools: Figma, Illustrator and VScode</p>
