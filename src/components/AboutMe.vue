    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm Luis, a results-driven and adaptable Fullstack Designer.
      With over 3 years of freelancing experience, I excel at problem-solving
      and infuse creativity into every project. I wear both the hat of a skilled
      designer and a pragmatic developer. But my journey doesn't stop there -
      I'm always eager to learn, enhance my skills, and seize new opportunities.
      Embracing challenges beyond my comfort zone is second nature to me, and
      I'm enthusiastic about the prospect of working internationally.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also boast a rich background in the realm of bespoke tailoring, having
      worked as an apprentice for two years in Madrid. During this period, I
      honed my skills in meticulous craftsmanship and developed an innate
      ability to swiftly adapt to diverse work settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a curiosity in my free time I train weightlifting and do the genealogy
      research of my family.
    </p>
    <p>My skills: UX design, HTML, CSS, Javascript and Vue.JS framework</p>
    <p>Tools: Figma, Adobe Illustrator and VScode</p>
